When using Rocket.Chat you have a plethora of customization options, ranging from basic color switching to full css control. Here you will find all the guides you need to customize your Rocket.Chat Server.

In these guides we will be talking about customizations without changing the source code, for that you can check our \[Developer Guides\].
