### Force SSL

You can use this setting to force SSL on your server. We **Strongly Discourage** the usage of this setting, this should be done at the reverse proxy level by redirecting to https.

### Robots.txt File Contents

This sets the content of the Robots.txt file, used to help indexing your server on different search engines and crawlers.

### Show Setup Wizard

## Iframe Integration

### Enable Receive

This setting defines if a parent window can send commands to Rocket.Chat.

### Receive Origins

Origins with protocol prefix, separated by commas, which are allowed to receive commands e.g. `https://localhost`, `http://localhost`, or \* to allow receiving from anywhere.

### Allow Getting Everything

This setting affects the `count` query parameter. See more at [Offset and Count Information](https://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/rest-api/offset-and-count-and-sort-info/#offset-and-count-information)

* **Yes**: Allows the usage of the number `0` as `count` parameter. Setting `count` to `0` will return **ALL** the data from that endpoint
* **No**: Setting the number `0` on `count`, will return `0` results.

> Should calls to the REST API be allowed to return everything in one call?

### CORS Origin

Here you can set what origins are allowed to make requests to your server.

> You can use `*` to accept from all origins. For multiple Origins use a comma separated list. E.g `domain1.com, domain2.com, domain3.com`

### Default Count

The default count for REST API results if the consumer did not provided any.

### Enable CORS

Use this setting to enable [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) for the REST API. Enabling CORS will make the server only accept API Calls from specific origins.

> **Note**: Setting this to false, will make your server only accept requests from the same domain of said server. E.g. `rocket.chat` server will only accept requests from the `rocket.chat` domain.

### Enable Direct Message History Endpoint

This enables the `/api/v1/im.history.others` which allows the viewing of direct messages sent by other users that the caller is not part of.

### Enable Shields

Enables the usage of [Shields](https://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/rest-api/miscellaneous/shield-svg/#shield-svg) via API

### Max Record Amount

This sets the maximum number of records the REST API should return when not set to unlimited

### User Limit for Adding All Users to Channel

This limits the amount of users that can be added to a Channel at the same time.

## Reporting

### Send Statistics to Rocket.Chat

By sending your statistics, you'll help us identify how many instances of Rocket.Chat are deployed, as well as how good the system is behaving, so we can further improve it. Don't worry, as no user information is sent and all the information we receive is kept confidential.

## Stream Cast

### Stream Cast Address

IP or Host of your Rocket.Chat central Stream Cast. E.g. `192.168.1.1:3000` or `localhost:4000`

## Translations

### Custom Translations

With this setting you can configure custom translations for your server.

Should be a valid JSON where keys are languages containing a dictionary of key and translations. Example:

```javascript
{
 "en": {
  "Channels": "Rooms"
 },
 "pt": {
  "Channels": "Salas"
 }
}
```

## UTF8

### UTF8 Names Validation

RegExp that will be used to validate usernames and channel names

> **Note**: If you are having problems with names when creating channels \(when using non-english characters for example\) changing these values will probably fix it.

## Update

### Update Latest Available Version

Whenever we have a new version available, it will show up on this field.
